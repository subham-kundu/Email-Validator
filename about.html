                <h1>eValidate - The Email Validator</h1>
                <p>
                    An email validator is a tool or program designed to verify the validity of an email address. Its primary purpose is to check whether an email address entered by a user conforms to the standard syntax rules for email addresses and whether the domain associated with the email address is valid and reachable.
                    <br><br>
                    Here are some common checks performed by an email validator:
                    <br><br>
                    1. Syntax Check: Verifying that the email address follows the standard syntax rules, including the presence of an "@" symbol, proper placement of dots, and adherence to character restrictions.
                    <br><br>
                    2. Domain Check: Ensuring that the domain (the part of the email address after the "@" symbol) is valid and has appropriate DNS records. This involves checking for the existence of the domain and verifying that it has the necessary mail exchange (MX) records.
                    <br><br>
                    3. Disposable Email Check: Identifying if the email address belongs to a disposable or temporary email service, which are often used for short-term purposes and may not be suitable for long-term communication.
                    <br><br>
                    4. Role-Based Email Check: Identifying email addresses associated with roles rather than individual users (e.g., admin@example.com, support@example.com).
                    <br><br>
                    5. Spam Trap Check: Detecting if the email address is associated with known spam traps, which are email addresses set up to catch and identify spammers.
                    <br><br>
                    6. SMTP Server Check: Verifying that the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server associated with the email domain is reachable, indicating that the domain can accept emails.
                    <br><br>
                    Email validation is commonly used in various applications, such as online forms, user registration processes, and marketing campaigns, to ensure the accuracy and legitimacy of the provided email addresses. It helps reduce bounce rates, enhance deliverability, and maintain the quality of contact lists.
